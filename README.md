# CacheQL
Research Artifact of USENIX Security 2023 paper: *CacheQL: Quantifying and Localizing Cache Side-Channel Vulnerabilities in Production Software*

## Note

Thank you for your interest in our work! ðŸ˜¬

*Update (26 Apr. 2023):* An unpolished version of the code is released at the [project page](https://sites.google.com/view/cache-ql/code). Still being swamped with lots of other things... ðŸ¥² I will restructure the code and write the document in this repo before the next deadline of USENIX Security'23 AE (June 9, 2023).

*Update (25 Feb. 2023):* I just realized I have missed the fall registration deadline of USENIX Security'23 AE... ðŸ«  The next AE submission is in June. Hopefully, I should have more time next month to prepare this artifact.

*Update (30 Sep. 2022):* The preprint and identified leakage sites are made available. Feel free to let me know if you have any questions.

## Updates

- 30 Sep. 2022. Release 1) preprint, 2) additional results, and 3) localized side channel leaks.

## Preprint

The preprint of our paper is available at: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.14952.pdf

## Additional Results

1. Quantification results of CacheQL, which depict how the leaked bits are distributed among most vulnerable functions in
OpenSSL, MbedTLS, and Libgcrypt, are available at: https://sites.google.com/view/cache-ql#h.7h3q1uiutamk

2. Evaluation results of PoC exploitations are available at: https://sites.google.com/view/cache-ql#h.hhrwufogvnxk

## Localized Vulnerabilities

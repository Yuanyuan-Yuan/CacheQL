# CacheQL
Research Artifact of USENIX Security 2023 paper: *CacheQL: Quantifying and Localizing Cache Side-Channel Vulnerabilities in Production Software*

## Updates

- 30 Sep. 2022. Release 1) preprint, 2) additional results, and 3) localized side channel leaks.

## Preprint

The preprint of our paper is available at: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.14952.pdf

## Additional Results

1. Quantification results of CacheQL, which depict how the leaked bits are distributed among most vulnerable functions in
OpenSSL, MbedTLS, and Libgcrypt, are available at: https://sites.google.com/view/cache-ql#h.7h3q1uiutamk

2. Evaluation results of PoC exploitations are available at: https://sites.google.com/view/cache-ql#h.hhrwufogvnxk

## Localized Vulnerabilities

You can access the full report of our localized side channel vulnerabilities at: https://sites.google.com/view/cache-ql#h.pgsarsaxsdsv

## Note

Thank you for your interest in our work! ðŸ˜¬

Since I will be very busy in next few months, I plan to release the code, data<s>, and our findlings</s> before the **fall deadline of USENIX Security'23 Artifact Evaluation** (i.e., Tuesday, March 7, 2023). If you have any questions and want a quick reply, do not hesitate to contact me directly via yyuanaq@cse.ust.hk.

*Update:* The preprint and identified leakage sites are made available. Feel free to let me know if you have any questions.
